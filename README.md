# graphql-en-devtools

GraphQL en Devtools :wrench:

Ever tired of searching for your graphql queries in the network tab? With each query having the same name - the name of the pretty dull endpoint (`/graphql`).

Install GraphQL en Devtools - created just for solving the problem of looking for your GraphQL Network calls. The extension displays - request variables and query and response status, time took and response body (content) all sorted with the Query/Mutation, here operation identifiers.

Features:

- Delete the Logged calls 🗑️
- Copy - Request Variables, Request Query, Response Content 📋
